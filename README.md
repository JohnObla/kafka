# Learning Process

Created this project to learn Ruby on Rails<br>
Below is a documentation of my learning process.

1. Decided to learn Kafka

2. Googled Kafka for videos on what Kafka actually is

2. Learned the concept of Kafka, to decouple data streams and systems by providing real time messaging

3. Found out the way companies use Kafka to provide real time interactions/analytics; Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn, etc.

4. Watched lecture by Confluent that explained the above concepts in more detail

	☝ The lecture also detailed Kafka's logs (Topics) and how each event is stored

5. Installed Docker

6. Started Confluent's tutorial series

7. Stopped Confluent's tutorial series as they had a very "code first, ask questions later" approach
	
	☝ I learn a lot better when I understand the concepts that I'm learning _before_ I start coding

8. Found a better Kafka learning series that also goes over the concepts too

9. Learned the basics of Topics, Partitions, and Offsets

10. Learned the basic of Brokers and Clusters, and how partitions are shared across Brokers

11. Learned about replication factors and partition leaders

12.
