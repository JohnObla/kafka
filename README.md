# Learning Process

Created this project to learn Ruby on Rails
Below is a documentation of my learning process.

1. Decided to learn Kafka 🥳

2. Searched Youtube for videos on what Kafka actually is

2. Learned the concept of Kafka, to decouple data streams and systems by providing real time messaging

3. Found out the way companies use Kafka to provide real time interactions/analytics; Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn, etc.

4. Watched lecture by Confluent that explained the above concepts in more detail

   ☝ The lecture also detailed Kafka's logs (Topics) and how each event is stored

5. Installed Docker 🐳

6. Started Confluent's tutorial series ✅

7. Stopped Confluent's tutorial series ❌ 
	
   ☝ They had a very "code first, ask questions later" approach, but I learn better when I understand the concepts that I'm learning _before_ I start coding

8. Found a better Kafka learning series ✅

    ☝ This series goes indepth on the concepts before coding

9. Learned the basics of Topics, Partitions, and Offsets

10. Learned the basic of Brokers and Clusters, and how partitions are shared across Brokers

11. Learned about Replication Factors and partition Leaders

12. Learned about Producers, their automatic load-balancing, and their different acknowlegement levels (0, 1, 2)

13. Learned about Producer message keys

15. Learned and Consumers and Consumer Groups

16. Learned about delivery Semantics for Consumers; At most once, At least once, Exactly once (🤩)

17.
